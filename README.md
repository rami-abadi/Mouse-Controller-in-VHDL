# Mouse-Controller-in-VHDL
i have designed a mouse controller unit in vhdl:
1-the mouse controller has 2 inout units called data and clock that form a serial communication unit for the mouse initialization and data reciving.
2-we also conrol the directions by implementing x_mov and y_mov on the horizontal and vertical directions
3-and the valid indicates a new data to be executed.
4- the clock frequency is 50MHZ.


All the code was implemented in Quartos and tested in ModelSim.
